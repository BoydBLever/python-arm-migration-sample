# Python ARM Migration Sample

This repository contains sample Python code that demonstrates common migration challenges from x86 to ARM architectures.

## Code Files

### `main.py`
- **Deprecated Functions**: The code uses `locale.getdefaultlocale()`, a function deprecated in Python 3.11 and slated for removal in Python 3.15.
- **Performance Optimization**: The `matrix_multiplication()` function performs a CPU-intensive operation (matrix multiplication), which can be optimized for ARM's NEON vectorization.

## Goals
The goal of this repository is to:
1. Identify and replace deprecated Python functions with alternatives that are ARM-compatible.
2. Explore optimization techniques that leverage ARM-specific features like NEON for better performance.
